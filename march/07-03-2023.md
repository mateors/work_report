# The work update of 07-03-2023

Today I have worked on the Youthict project. I have designed four sections in HTML (about us section, course section, video section, and counter section). Also, I have designed a testimonial section and the Gov. job getters section in Figma as per client instruction. The work directory is uploaded on github repo.
